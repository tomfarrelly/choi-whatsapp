twilio whatsapp costs:

$0.005 per message (sent or received)
plus metas conversation fees (passed through)

metas fees:

first 1,000 conversations/month: free
after that: ~$0.01 per conversation (24-hour window)

so for choi:

user texts choi → free conversation from meta, but $0.005 twilio fee per message
after 1,000 free conversations → ~$0.015 per interaction ($0.01 meta + $0.005 twilio)

load credit and pay as fans text
for 2000 messages after the free 1k:

twilio: ~$10
meta: ~$10
total: ~$20 (plus openai ~$5)

So around $25 total for 2000 messages once past the free tier
